About This Project
-------------------------
This is the backend for the bookstore frontend! These two repositories only work when ran together. This backend is what gives the bookstore frontend the books
it displays and is also where the orders get sent. 

How To Use
-------------------------
The database is not uploaded to this repository so there's some commented in code that creates that database
and adds in a few books. Uncomment them, run the file, and there should be a database. Additionally, enter the following into the terminal
before running:

$env:FLASK_APP="bookstore.py"
$env:FLASK_ENV="development"
